*** Chapter I: System requirements

Grader has been tested on CentOS 7 and is the recommended platform, however
it should also work on other UNIX OS'es and Windows. This guide assumes you
are using CentOS.

Grader requires the following:

0. Some free disk space
1. A webserver
   -> yum install httpd
2. PHP >= 5.3.0
   -> yum install php
3. A MySQL (or compatible) server
   -> yum install mariadb-server (CentOS 7)
   -> yum install mysql-server (CentOS 6)


*** Chapter II: Webserver configuration

Select a location to install grader. This guide assumes /var/www/html/grader
and no other specific webserver configuration has been made.

The source contains a .htaccess with all the necessary webserver configuration
for Apache's httpd. You do have to allow the webserver to process .htaccess
files, which you can do as following:

<Directory /var/www/html/grader>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>

Grader requires its own virtual host because it needs to be at the root. Without
going in details, a quick snippet on how to configure a virtual host:

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName grader.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/grader
</VirtualHost>


*** Chapter III: Installing webserver files

Extract the .tar.gz file to your wwwroot or a subdirectory thereof.

tar -xf grader.tar.gz /var/www/html/grader


*** Chapter IV: Running setup

Go to http://localhost/grader/setup.php

The setup will try to automatically create and write out the contents of the
configuration file dptcms/config.php. For that, the config.php file needs to be
created and its permissions set so the webserver can write to it:

touch /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php
chmod 666 /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php
chmod o+rw /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php
chcon -t httpd_user_rw_content_t /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php

If setup is unable to modify the config.php file, it will allow you to download
it so you can manually upload it to the webserver. Setup will also try to modify
the permissions of config.php to 664. If it was unable to do so, execute the
following command:

chmod 664 dptcms/config.php

Setup steps

1 Check system requirements (PHP version, MySQL lib, mod_rewrite works)
2 Ask for database details
  Setup can automatically create the MySQL user and database. To do that,
  enable the checkbox "Create user and database for me" and enter the username
  and password of the root MySQL user (or another MySQL user that has
  sufficient privileges to write to mysql.user and create databases). Setup
  will then proceed to create a new user according to what you've entered.
  Otherwise you must create a user and database yourself.
3 Database connection test
  Setup will run some basic queries to verify the information is correct. If
  a test fails, make the necessary configuration changes to the database server
  and click "Retest".
4 Database creation
  Setup will now create the necessary objects on the database server and
  import the database schema.
5 First user account
  You are now being asked to provide a username and password. This will be the
  first user created in the grader system, which also has full administrative
  privileges. After setup has completed, you can use this username and password
  to log in and administer grader.
6 Site configuration
  Some additional site configuration parameters can be adjust here.
7 Create configuration file
  Setup will now attemp to write out grader's configuration file.
8 Finish
  Setup has completed! You can now login to your new grader installation.
  DELETE THE FILE setup.php, for security reasons. It is no longer necessary.
  Any upgrades of grader will install a new copy of setup.php which can be used
  to perform upgrades. After upgrades you should delete setup.php again.


*** Chapter V: Upgrading from an earlier version

(This chapter is currently a placeholder as there are no upgrades yet)
Remove all files except dptcms/config.php

Extract the .tar.gz to the same directory of the old installation

Go to http://your.url/setup.php
