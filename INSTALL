*** Chapter 0: For the impatient

yum install httpd php php-mysql
tar -xf grader.tar.gz /var/www/html/grader
cat << EOF
<Directory /var/www/html/grader>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>
EOF > /etc/httpd/conf.d/grader.conf
touch /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php
chmod 666 /var/www/html/grader/dptcms/config.php
systemctl reload httpd

Open browser to http://localhost/grader/setup.php and follow the steps


*** Chapter I: System requirements

Grader has been tested on CentOS 7 and is the recommended platform, however
it should also work on other UNIX OS'es and Windows. This guide assumes you
are using CentOS.

Grader requires the following:

0. Some free disk space
1. A webserver
   -> yum install httpd
2. PHP >= 5.3.0
   -> yum install php
3. A MySQL (or compatible) server
   -> yum install mariadb


*** Chapter II: Webserver configuration

Select a location to install grader. This guide assumes /var/www/html/grader
and no other specific webserver configuration has been made.

The source contains a .htaccess with all the necessary webserver configuration
for Apache's httpd. You do have to allow the webserver to process .htaccess
files, which you can do as following:

<Directory /var/www/html/grader>
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>

systemctl reload httpd


*** Chapter III: Installing webserver files

Extract the .tar.gz file to your wwwroot or a subdirectory thereof.

tar -xf grader.tar.gz /var/www/html/grader

*** Chapter IV: Running setup

Go to http://localhost/grader/setup.php

The setup will try to automatically create and write out the contents of the
configuration file dptcms/config.php.

touch dptcms/config.php
chmod 666 dptcms/config.php

If setup is unable to modify the config.php file, it will allow you to download
it so you can manually upload it to the webserver. Setup will also try to modify
the permissions of config.php to 664. If it was unable to do so, execute the
following command:

chmod 664 dptcms/config.php



Setup steps

0 Check system requirements (PHP version, MySQL lib, mod_rewrite works)
1 Ask for database details
 -> root user for creating database & grader user
 -> grader user to be created and/or set random password
2 Do connect test
3 Check if installing or upgrading
3.1 Install
3.1.1 Create database
3.1.2 Create user
3.1.3 Import SQL file
3.1.4 Write out new config file
3.1.5 Change permissions on config.php
3.2 Upgrade
3.2.1 Ask for backup
3.2.2 Apply SQL diff
4 Delete setup.php and redirect to index.php



*** Chapter V: Upgrading from an earlier version

Remove all files except dptcms/config.php

Extract the .tar.gz to the same directory of the old installation

Go to http://your.url/setup.php
