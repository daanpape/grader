 * Some rules to play by:
 * - Prefix global language snippets with g_
 *   Global language snippets are those that are being used on multiple pages
 *   and are mostly generic. For example:
 *   g_submit: "Submit"
 *   g_cancel: "Cancel"
 * - Prefix page specific snippets with <namepage>_
 *   For example:
 *   edituser_firstname: "Firstname"
 *   projects_selectcourse: "Select course"
